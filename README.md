# AI-pendulum
My first AI script which tries to hold a pendulum upright or, in a later stage, multiple pendulums
Also my first git repository

init the AI_agent script to start the AI

I used torch.py for data training; based on an AI agent from a snake game,
and matplotlib.pyplot / IPython.display for plotting the learning data.
The pendulum itself uses pymunk.py for physics and pygame for display
